description = [[
Bombardier is a new class that is a variant of the Alchemist. Bombardiers forgo using a golem in order to focus more on the effects of their bombs and their own combat viability.

- No golem,
- Bombs never hurt self or allies.
- Compared to Alchemists, Bombardier bombs do a little more damage at the low end, but a little less damage at the high end.
- Flame bombs can stun, Ice bombs can slow and freeze, Acid bombs can disarm, and Lightning bombs can daze.
- Alchemy infusion sustain cooldowns are reduced to 10 and the usage speed made instant to encourage switching.
- The second talent in each alchemy tree is now a passive bomb effect that buffs self and allies or, in the case of the Explosives tree, debuffs enemies. The Smoke Bomb talent was removed for one of these passive bomb effects.

A new Bombardier class which is a variant of the Alchemist. Bombardiers forgo using a golem in order to focus more on the effects of their bombs and their own combat viability.

- No golem.
- Bombs never hurt self or allies.
- Flame bombs can stun, Ice bombs can slow and freeze, Acid bombs can disarm, and Lightning bombs can daze.
- Alchemy infusion sustain cooldowns are reduced to 10 and the usage speed made instant to encourage switching.
- The second talent in each alchemy tree is now a passive bomb effect that buffs self and allies or, in the case of the Explosives tree, debuffs enemies. The Smoke Bomb talent from the flame-alchemy tree was removed for one of these passive bomb effects.
